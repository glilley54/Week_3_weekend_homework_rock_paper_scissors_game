    <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple. <br>
        The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors.</p> <br>
    

        
    <p>The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:</p>
        
    <p>
    <ol>

    Rock wins against scissors. <br>
    Scissors win against paper. <br>
    Paper wins against rock. <br>
</ol>
